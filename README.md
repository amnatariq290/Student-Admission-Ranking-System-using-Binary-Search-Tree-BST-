Student Admission Ranking System using Binary Search Tree (BST)

This project is a simple Python-based implementation of a **Student Admission Ranking System** using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. It was developed as part of a Complex Engineering Problem (CEP) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Insert student records by admission score
- In-order traversal to print students in ascending score order
- Search student by score
- Print students within a specific score range
- Display how many students scored less than a given score (ranking)
- Menu-driven CLI interface
- Prevents duplicate scores

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each student record contains:
- Name
- Application ID
- Admission Score

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Custom implementation of Binary Search Tree (no external libraries)

## ðŸ›  How to Run
```bash
python student_admission_bst.py
```
Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the system.

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced concepts of tree data structures
- Practiced recursion, traversal, and complexity analysis
- Understood real-life application of BSTs for ranking/search systems
